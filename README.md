- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @arthurcantcode, first name's Arthur, as you might have already guessed. I'm an Engineering and Industrial Management student, currently on the last year before getting my degree. I've also dived into Computer Engineering, for a year (C# got me runnin' lol), later I got into Telecommunications Engineering for three years in a public university, all of that back in my native country, Brazil. As of September 2018 I'm living and studying in Portugal. 
I've decided try and learn programming (again), mainly how to code in Python, for it's readability and versatility. I'm a total newbie at this point (October 2021) but I'm looking forward to improve my skills and coding logic as much as I can.
